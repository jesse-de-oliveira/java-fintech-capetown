WEEK 3 - DAY 1 - POSTGRESQL SETUP + CONNECTION
Monday Feb 16, 2026
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHY DATABASES?
- In-memory storage (Week 2): Data lost on restart.
- Database storage (Week 3): Data persists forever.

WHAT IS POSTGRESQL?
- Open-source relational database.
- ACID transactions (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable).
- Critical for financial applications to ensure data integrity.



INSTALLATION:
✓ PostgreSQL 16 installed.
✓ pgAdmin 4 for GUI management.
✓ Database created: expense_tracker_db.
✓ User: postgres, Password: postgres123 (dev only).

SPRING BOOT CONNECTION:
- Added dependencies: postgresql driver & spring-boot-starter-data-jpa.
- Configuration in application.properties:
  * URL: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/expense_tracker_db
  * ddl-auto: update (set to automatically sync schema once entities are defined).
  * show-sql: true (to monitor Hibernate's upcoming generation).

ORM (Object-Relational Mapping):
- Hibernate = The engine that maps Java Objects ↔ Database Tables.
- Current Status: The bridge is built (Connection), but no traffic is flowing (No Entities).

WHAT HAPPENED (TODAY'S PROGRESS):
1. Successfully installed the PostgreSQL database engine.
2. Created the physical 'expense_tracker_db' container.
3. Established a "handshake" between Spring Boot and the Database.
4. Verified that the app starts without "Connection Refused" errors.



NOTE ON TABLE GENERATION:
- The 'transaction' table does NOT exist yet. 
- Hibernate requires the @Entity annotation to recognize a class as a database table.
- Currently, the database is empty, awaiting tomorrow's mapping.

ARCHITECTURE EVOLUTION:
- Week 1: Pure Java (Logic only).
- Week 2: In-memory (ArrayList).
- Week 3: Infrastructure Ready (PostgreSQL connected).

ACID PROPERTIES (Fintech Focus):
- Atomicity: "All or nothing" (e.g., Money leaves A AND arrives at B).
- Consistency: No illegal data states.
- Isolation: Transactions don't "bump" into each other.
- Durability: Once saved, it's permanent.

TESTING COMPLETED:
✓ PostgreSQL engine is running.
✓ pgAdmin connects to 'Local PostgreSQL'.
✓ Spring Boot console shows "Connected to: PostgreSQL 16".
✓ NO connection timeout/authentication errors.

NEXT STEPS:
- Day 2: Convert Transaction.java to a JPA Entity (The magic moment).
- Day 3: Create Repository (The database query tool).
